# parrot

Hold `fn`, speak, release. Your words appear at the cursor. On-device dictation for macOS.

> **This fork** learns the spellings you correct, imports what Wispr Flow learned, and can ask an LLM of your choice to judge each learned word pair. It has its own bundle ID (`io.github.riturajtiwari.parrot`) and no automatic updates. Build it with `scripts/dev-install.sh`. See [docs/corrections.md](docs/corrections.md) and [ADR-006](docs/decisions/006-learned-corrections.md).

## 1. Install

Download [Parrot.dmg](https://github.com/humanitas-labs/parrot/releases/latest/download/Parrot.dmg), drag Parrot to Applications, and open it. Turn on Parrot when macOS asks for Accessibility and the microphone. The first start downloads the speech model (about 150 MB).

Or from a terminal, which also installs the `parrot` command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://perroquet.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

Requires macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon. Parrot is signed and notarized, so permissions survive updates, and it updates itself: it checks once a day, and **Check for Updates…** in its menu checks now. Upgrading from the command-line version: open the new app once and it replaces the old install.

## 2. Usage

1. Click into any text field.
2. Hold `fn` and speak. A small pill at the bottom of the screen shows the mic is live. On a keyboard where `fn` does nothing (Logitech and most third-party keyboards), choose another key under **Hotkey** in **Settings…**: left or right Option, Command, Control, or Shift. The change applies from the next press.
3. Release. The transcript is pasted at the cursor, usually within 200–300 ms, and your clipboard is restored.

Choose **Launch at login** in **Settings…** to start Parrot with your Mac. A tap shorter than 0.3 s, or a hold with another modifier, is ignored, so shortcuts on the hotkey still work. If `fn` is mapped to input source or emoji, `parrot doctor` shows how to fix it.

To dictate in another language, choose a multilingual model in Settings (⌘, from the menu), then either one Language or Automatic. Automatic detects which of the languages under **Languages** each dictation is in, and never picks one you haven't listed. The list starts as your Mac's languages.

## 3. Dictionary

Add your names and technical terms to `~/.config/parrot/dictionary`, a plain-text table of each word and what the model writes instead, and Parrot spells them your way. **Open Dictionary File** in Settings opens it. Edits apply on the next dictation. See [docs/dictionary.md](docs/dictionary.md).

## 4. CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `parrot` | Run in the foreground (^C to quit) |
| `parrot setup` | One-time setup: permissions and model download |
| `parrot doctor` | Check permissions, and the `fn` key setting when the hotkey is `fn` |
| `parrot install --launch-at-login` | Start Parrot at login |
| `parrot install --cli` | Link `/usr/local/bin/parrot` to Parrot.app |
| `parrot install --uninstall` | Stop launching at login and remove logs |
| `parrot models list` | List available models |
| `parrot --model whisper-large-v3-turbo` | Larger, multilingual model |
| `parrot --hotkey right-option` | Use another key for this run only; Settings… changes the saved key |
| `parrot --no-overlay` | Hide the recording pill |
| `parrot --inject-mode type-unicode` | Type instead of paste (leaves the clipboard alone) |

## 5. How it works

WhisperKit runs Whisper on the Apple Neural Engine via CoreML, AVAudioEngine captures the mic, a CGEventTap watches the hotkey, and a synthesized ⌘V pastes the result. Nothing leaves your Mac, and logs never contain what you said. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## 6. Build from source

```sh
swift build -c release && swift test
scripts/dev-install.sh      # build, sign, install Parrot.app, link the CLI
```

This fork signs with a Developer ID or, without one, a free Apple Development certificate, so the Microphone and Accessibility grants survive rebuilds. To make the certificate, open Xcode → **Settings → Accounts**, add your Apple ID, select your **Personal Team**, click **Manage Certificates…**, and add **Apple Development**. If `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` then finds no valid identity, the Mac lacks Apple's WWDR G3 intermediate certificate. Xcode ships a copy:

```sh
security import /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTFoundation.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AppleWWDRCA-2030.cer -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

When `/usr/local/bin` is not writable, `PARROT_LINK_DIR=~/.local/bin scripts/dev-install.sh` links the command there, with no `sudo`.
